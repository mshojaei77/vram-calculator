## Understanding GPU Requirements

Large language models (LLMs) require significant computational resources, with VRAM (Video RAM) often being the primary limiting factor. Running these models involves:

1. **Loading model weights**: The parameters that define the model
2. **Computing activations**: Intermediate values during inference
3. **Storing KV cache**: For context retention during text generation
4. **Optimizer states and gradients**: During training or fine-tuning

Key factors affecting VRAM usage:
- **Model Size**: More parameters require more VRAM
- **Precision/Quantization**: Lower-precision models use less VRAM
- **Context Length**: Larger context windows increase VRAM usage
- **Implementation Details**: Frameworks, batch size, and optimization techniques

## Key GPU Specifications

When selecting a GPU for LLMs, prioritize these specifications:

### VRAM Capacity
The most critical factor. Determines the largest model size and maximum context length you can run.

### VRAM Bandwidth
Higher bandwidth allows faster data transfer between VRAM and GPU cores, improving performance.

### Tensor Cores
NVIDIA GPUs with Tensor Cores offer significant acceleration for transformer-based models:
- Ampere architecture (RTX 30 series) or newer
- A100/H100 for professional applications

### Compute Capability
For NVIDIA GPUs, higher compute capability means better library support:
- 7.0+ for basic support
- 7.5+ for good performance
- 8.0+ for optimal performance

### PCIe Generation
PCIe 4.0 or newer provides faster data transfer, beneficial when models don't fit entirely in VRAM.

## Memory Usage Fundamentals

The total VRAM consumption of an LLM is determined by several key components, each contributing to the overall memory footprint during inference or training.

### Model Size and Parameters

The parameter count directly determines base VRAM requirements:
- Higher parameter counts signify greater model capacity
- Larger models need more VRAM to store weights and perform computations

The most straightforward estimation of VRAM needed for model parameters is:

```
VRAM (bytes) = Number of Parameters × Bytes per Parameter
```

For example, a 7B parameter model in FP16 (2 bytes per parameter) requires approximately 14GB just for its weights.

### Precision and Quantization

The precision format dramatically affects VRAM requirements:

| Format | Bytes per Parameter | Quality Impact | Memory Reduction (vs FP16) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| FP32 (32-bit) | 4.0 | Highest precision, used during training | -100% (2× more memory) |
| FP16/BF16 (16-bit) | 2.0 | Good balance, common for inference | Baseline |
| INT8 (8-bit) | 1.0 | Moderate quality impact | 50% |
| INT4 (4-bit) | 0.5 | Noticeable but often acceptable | 75% |
| INT3 (3-bit) | 0.375 | Significant quality trade-offs | 81.25% |
| INT2 (2-bit) | 0.25 | Extreme compression, quality degradation | 87.5% |

Quantization allows larger models to run on hardware with limited VRAM. Modern quantization methods (like GPTQ, AWQ, and HQQ) can achieve better quality-to-size ratios than basic quantization.

### Context Window and KV Cache

The context window significantly impacts VRAM usage through the Key-Value (KV) cache:

- Larger context enables more coherent, contextually relevant responses
- The KV cache grows linearly with context length and model layers
- For long contexts (32K+), KV cache can require more VRAM than the model weights

The memory required for the KV cache can be calculated as:

```
Memory per Token = 2 × Number of Layers × Hidden Dimension Size × Bytes per Cached Value
Total KV Cache = Memory per Token × Sequence Length × Batch Size
```

For example, for a model with 32 layers and a hidden dimension of 4096 using FP16 precision (2 bytes):
- Memory per token: 2 × 32 × 4096 × 2 bytes = 0.5 MB per token
- For a sequence length of 8K: 0.5 MB × 8,000 tokens = 4 GB

## VRAM Requirements by Model Size

### Inference Requirements (Base Model)

| Model Size | FP16 (16-bit) | INT8 (8-bit) | INT4 (4-bit) | INT3 (3-bit) | INT2 (2-bit) |
|------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 3B         | ~7 GB         | ~4 GB        | ~2.5 GB      | ~2 GB        | ~1.5 GB      |

| 30B        | ~62 GB        | ~32 GB       | ~18 GB       | ~12 GB       | ~9 GB        |
| 70B        | ~142 GB       | ~72 GB       | ~40 GB       | ~28 GB       | ~20 GB       |

### Additional VRAM for Context Length

| Context Length | Standard Attention | With Flash Attention |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 2K tokens      | ~0.3 GB           | ~0.1 GB              |
| 8K tokens      | ~1.2 GB           | ~0.3 GB              |
| 32K tokens     | ~5 GB             | ~0.8 GB              |
| 100K tokens    | ~15 GB            | ~2 GB                |
| 1M tokens      | ~150 GB           | ~10 GB               |

### Fine-tuning Requirements

| Model Size | Full Fine-tuning | LoRA | QLoRA |
|------------|------------------|------|-------|
| 3B         | 20-40 GB         | 8-15 GB | 6-12 GB |
| 7B         | 80-120 GB        | 25-40 GB | 12-24 GB |
| 13B        | 150-200 GB       | 40-70 GB | 24-40 GB |
| 30B        | 350-450 GB       | 100-150 GB | 50-80 GB |
| 70B        | 800-1000 GB      | 200-300 GB | 100-150 GB |

### VRAM Calculation Formulas

For more accurate VRAM estimation during inference, use these formulas:

**Basic Formula:**
```
VRAM = (Model Parameters × Bytes per Parameter) + KV Cache + Overhead
```

**Formula with Quantization Factor:**
```
VRAM (GB) = (P × 4 × (Q/32) × 1.2
```
Where:
- P is the parameters in billions
- Q is the bit precision (16 for FP16, 8 for INT8, etc.)
- 1.2 represents a 20% overhead factor

**KV Cache Formula:**
```
KV Cache (bytes) = 2 × Layers × Hidden_Dim × Seq_Length × Batch_Size × Bytes_per_Value
```

When estimating total VRAM for practical use, consider:
- Additional activation memory (grows with batch size)
- Framework overhead (typically 0.5-1GB)
- Gradient and optimizer states for training (can be 2-3× the model size)
